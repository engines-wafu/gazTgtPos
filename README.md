# NADIR Target Position Calculator (TPC)

## Introduction

This tool uses octave programming language to generate UTM and MGRS grid coordinates of targets from the Gazelle NADIR and Viviane camera.  It will also automatically provide an UTM-MGRS grid conversion of your current position.

The intent is for this tool to be used by SA342 pilots in the CAS, JTAC, and FAC(A) roles.
